Non-negotiable engineering goals

This project must strongly prioritize the following:

Performance

I care a lot about speed.

Design and implement with strong performance awareness:
	•	fast startup
	•	fast page loads
	•	fast API responses
	•	low unnecessary overhead
	•	efficient queries
	•	efficient background processing
	•	minimal wasteful abstraction
	•	careful serialization and data movement
	•	sensible caching where it helps
	•	support for concurrency where appropriate

Do not build this like a slow enterprise CRUD app.

Reliability

I care a lot about correctness and resilience.

Design for:
	•	clear failure handling
	•	retries with backoff where appropriate
	•	idempotent job execution where possible
	•	audit logs and traceability
	•	health checks
	•	clean shutdown behavior
	•	restart-safe behavior
	•	migration safety
	•	robust validation
	•	defensive config parsing
	•	graceful handling of partial failures

Modern stack

Use a modern, strong, practical stack.

Bias toward:
	•	high-performance backend services
	•	clean typed APIs
	•	modern frontend patterns
	•	containerized local development
	•	good DX
	•	observability built in from early stages
	•	current best practices without overengineering

Self-built as much as possible

I want to build as much of the platform logic ourselves as is reasonable.

That means:
	•	build our own orchestration/control-plane logic rather than just wrapping a huge existing platform
	•	build our own metadata/catalog layer
	•	build our own reporting application
	•	build our own service integration patterns
	•	build our own docs generation layer

It is fine to use solid building blocks, but do not solve this by mostly wiring together prebuilt heavy platforms. I do not want a project that is just “compose up 12 off-the-shelf products.”

The interesting parts should be ours.

Fast local development

This should run well locally on a developer machine.

Prioritize:
	•	straightforward local setup
	•	Docker Compose for local orchestration
	•	fast edit/build/test loop
	•	sensible service boundaries
	•	good seed data and dev workflows

⸻

Preferred stack

Use this stack unless you can justify something better:

Backend / control plane
	•	Go for core platform/backend/control-plane services
	•	Strong emphasis on performance, concurrency, reliability, and clean architecture

Data work
	•	Python for ingestion and transformation tasks where Python is the right tool
	•	SQL for analytics transformations and serving logic where appropriate

Frontend
	•	React + TypeScript
	•	Prefer a clean, modern UI architecture
	•	Fast, functional, operator-friendly, minimal fluff

Storage / state
	•	Postgres for application metadata, control-plane state, job history, docs metadata, etc.
	•	DuckDB for analytics/query-serving workloads where appropriate
	•	Optional local object storage abstraction only if justified

Messaging / async
	•	Prefer a lightweight, practical queue/event approach
	•	Redis is acceptable if justified
	•	Do not introduce unnecessary distributed systems complexity

Infra / local platform
	•	Docker Compose
	•	Clear local dev workflows
	•	Version-controlled service definitions

Observability
	•	Build observability into the platform early
	•	Include structured logs, metrics, health endpoints, and traceability
	•	You may use practical libraries or standards, but keep the platform logic ours

What I want you to do first

Do not start coding immediately.

I want you to begin by acting like a serious architect and producing a thoughtful implementation plan.

Phase 1: Architecture and planning

First, inspect the repo and then produce:
	1.	A proposed system architecture
	2.	A proposed service decomposition
	3.	A proposed repo / monorepo structure
	4.	A proposed data model
	5.	A proposed job orchestration model
	6.	A proposed metadata/catalog model
	7.	A proposed analytics serving model
	8.	A proposed observability model
	9.	A proposed CI/CD strategy
	10.	A proposed phased delivery plan

For each of these, explain:
	•	why the design is good
	•	what tradeoffs you are making
	•	where performance concerns matter
	•	where reliability concerns matter
	•	where complexity should be intentionally limited

Phase 2: challenge your own design

After proposing the architecture, critique it.

Explicitly identify:
	•	likely bottlenecks
	•	likely reliability risks
	•	likely sources of accidental complexity
	•	where the system could become too slow
	•	where local developer experience could degrade
	•	what should be postponed to later phases

Phase 3: recommend the first concrete implementation slice

Then propose the best v1 slice to build first.

This v1 should be:
	•	meaningful
	•	vertical, not just scaffolding
	•	performance-conscious
	•	reliable
	•	demonstrably useful
	•	locally runnable end to end

I want the first slice to prove the architecture, not just create empty folders.

Functional expectations

The system should eventually support concepts like these:

Pipelines and jobs
	•	pipeline definitions
	•	task definitions
	•	dependencies
	•	retries
	•	schedules
	•	manual runs
	•	execution logs
	•	run status transitions
	•	failure metadata
	•	idempotency support
	•	input/output tracking

Data platform layers
	•	raw
	•	staging
	•	intermediate
	•	marts
	•	metrics

Metadata and docs
	•	data source catalog
	•	dataset registry
	•	table/column docs
	•	lineage
	•	owners
	•	schedules
	•	freshness
	•	quality checks
	•	documentation coverage

Observability
	•	service health
	•	job throughput
	•	failure counts
	•	run durations
	•	queue depth
	•	freshness lag
	•	structured logs
	•	diagnostics surfaces

Analytics serving
	•	metric endpoints
	•	chart-ready data responses

Quality bar

I want this to have a high engineering bar.

Please optimize for:
	•	clean architecture
	•	maintainable code
	•	typed contracts
	•	strong naming
	•	strong boundaries
	•	testability
	•	clarity over cleverness
	•	thoughtful abstractions
	•	performance-aware implementation
	•	reliable local operation

Avoid:
	•	unnecessary frameworks
	•	overcomplication
	•	premature microservices sprawl
	•	excessive YAML complexity
	•	magical hidden behavior
	•	overly abstract generic systems too early
	•	slow, bloated frontend patterns
	•	excessive reliance on third-party platforms for core logic

⸻

Build philosophy

Treat this as if you are building an internal platform product for serious technical users.

That means:
	•	operator UX matters
	•	errors must be understandable
	•	diagnostics must be first-class
	•	state transitions must be explicit
	•	docs should be generated where possible
	•	defaults should be sane
	•	local development should be pleasant
	•	the code should teach good engineering by example

I want to learn from the implementation quality and architectural decisions.

Constraints
	•	This is local-first
	•	It should be able to run on a capable developer machine
	•	It should be self-hostable
	•	It should not require a cloud provider
	•	It should be reasonably modular
	•	It should be realistic to build iteratively
	•	Heavy external platform dependencies should be minimized
	•	Prefer our own implementation for core control-plane and metadata logic
	- 	I have an m4 mac with 24gb of ram and able to host a few containers or a linux vm via Orbstack on this machine
